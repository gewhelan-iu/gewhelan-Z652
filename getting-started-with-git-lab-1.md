# Getting started with Git Lab
## Instructions
In this lab, we'll be going through some basic tasks you'll need to do as you manage the GitHub repository for your CollectionBuilder site. The questions below are designed to help you learn and remember what you need to do to perform these tasks, as well as where you can go to look for help. 
## Creating your repository and editing files
**What did you click on to create a new repository in the web interface of Github (i.e., on Github.com)?**

In the "Repositories" tab, I clicked the button labeled "New."

**What is the difference between a private and a public repository?**

A public repository is accessible by any user. Private repositories require some kind of authentication to be accessed.

**Once your repository has been made and has at least one file, what button do you need to click on the web interface in order to create a new file in your repository?**

The button labelled "Add file."

**Describe the steps you took to clone your repository on Github Desktop**

After signing in with my GitHub account, I selected the "add existing repository" option and selected my existing repository.

**What is the title of GitHub documentation?**

docs.github.com

**What is the URL for GitHub documentation on creating your first repository?**

https://docs.github.com/fr/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo

**Where is your local repository versus the remote repository?**

The local repository is stored on my computer. The remote repository is stored on GitHub servers.

**What happens when you fetch?** 

Fetch compares the remote and local repositories, and downloads any remote files which have been modified more recently than the local copies, or which are only present on the remote repository. Any changes are not immediately committed.

**What happens when you pull changes/commits?**

Pull compares the remote and local repositories, and downloads any remote files which have been modified more recently than the local copies, or which are only present on the remote repository. Any changes are immediately committed.

**When working on GitHub Desktop, what order should you generally perform push, pull, and fetch?**

You should first fetch, then pull, then push after you have made your changes.

**What happens when you push commits from your local repository?**

The same process as when you pull, but in reverse.

**What is the URL for the Github glossary?**

https://docs.github.com/fr/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary

**Where can you find a list of your commits?**

In the "About" tab of your repository view, by pressing the button labeled "Activity," or in the "History" tab of the GitHub Desktop left sidebar.

**What is the URL for documentation on reverting a commit?**

https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits/reverting-a-commit-in-github-desktop

**How do you revert a commit?**

Navigate to the "History" tab of the GitHub Desktop left sidebar, right-click the commit you would like to revert, and click "Revert Changes in Commit."

## Git-flavored markdown
**What is the name of the page or URL in GitHub documentation where there's information on how to format your Markdown for GitHub?**

https://github.github.com/gfm/

**What precedes a second-level heading in Github markdown?**

Two hashtags.

**How do you indicate text that has been struckthrough?**

Surround it with tildes (~)

**How do you create a hyperlink in your markdown?**

Surround link text with square brackets ([]), followed without a space by the link address in parentheses.

**How do you link to a section in the same or another markdown file?**

For links to a section in the same file, use the link address "#section-title". For links to a different file, use the link address "path-to-article#section-title".

**What are the three possible symbols for indicating an unordered list?**

\- + *
